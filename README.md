Hibernate is a framework for persisting/ saving java objects in database
  1. Handle all the low level sql
  2. Minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop
  3. Hibernate provides the object to relational mapping(ORM)
  
  In here I have use to save only one object at once to the database.
